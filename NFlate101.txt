INTRODUCTION
************
Expansion of NES ROMs is typically simple.
Although actually USING that space will undoubtably require ASM hacks.

This is a simple program that will take care of the physical ROM expansion.
Of course, it'll be up to you to do the ASM hacks to make it work.

USAGE
*****
Couldn't be simpler.

Just run the EXE.
It'll ask you for the original ROM file (unlike my earlier utils, I finally made it
support spaces in the filename).
Then it'll ask you what to save the expanded file as. Again, spaces should work.
Next, it'll ask if you want the PRG expanded. 1 for yes, 0 for no.
Then it'll ask if you want the CHR expanded. Again, 1 for yes, 0 for no.

NOTES
*****
Some mappers might require an unusual expansion.
I've added support for the special cases I'm aware of:

iNES mapper #1 (Nintendo MMC1), expanded to above 256KB
-------------------------------------------------------
When an MMC1 game has more than 256KB of PRG-ROM, there is an extra
register that determines which 256KB portion of the ROM is active.
So, the ROM must be expanded by adding extra space to the end of the PRG.

NOTE: I believe I made a fix since the version 1.0. I didn't replicate the
original PRG-ROM, but I should have (I just added blank space).

iNES mapper #19 (Namcot 106)
----------------------------
It seems that this mapper need extra space at the beginning of the PRG-ROM.
True of Kaiju Monogatari and Megami Tensei 2.

iNES mapper #82 (Taito Mapper #4)
---------------------------------
I expanded one ROM similar to MMC1 >256.
Not sure if it's the proper way, but it works.
